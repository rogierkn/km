<h1>Making a case for semantically annotated news articles</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>These days the Semantic Web is becoming more of a reality. Search engines such as Google are using the data found
       on the Semantic Web to enhance their search results [Haas et al. 2011]. Schema.org, an initiative of companies
       behind the major search engines, is largely to thank for that. It provides a vocabulary that covers many concepts
       and is easy to use for content providers [Guha et al. 2016].</p>
    <p>
        The domain of newspapers, more specifically news articles, however, seems to not join in on this growth as much
        as other domains. Newspapers are not adding much data to articles. An odd newspaper adds some JSON+LD to the
        HTML to describe the metadata of the article but none semantically annotate the actual article.
    </p>
    <p>
        This focus paper tries to make a case for semantically annotating news articles. This is done by describing the
        current situation, state why annotated articles area good thing, and explain how it can be achieved. Finally the
        potential disadvantages are given for certain approaches. This allows the reader to draw a conclusion whether or
        not it is worth it.
    </p>

    <h3>Current situation</h3>

    <p>
        Currently many newspapers do not, or barely employ the practice of linked data in their websites. This section
        will perform an analysis on a sample of ten newspapers. These ten newspapers represent the larger news outlets
        that should have more resources to implement newer technologies. A recent topic is selected to make sure that
        the articles analysed are recent as well, and not outdated with perhaps old or invalid data.
        The analysis will check whether or not linked data present in the web pages, by using Google’s structured data
        testing tool, and if the actual article is semantically annotated.

        <caption><strong>different newspapers and their use of linked data</strong></caption>
    </table>


    <p>
        The analysis shows, table 1, that all newspapers include some form of linked data. Most of the linked data is
        used to attach metadata that might be useful for other applications, e.g. search engines listing metadata of
        articles when certain keywords of a search query match a headline. None of the articles had their content
        semantically annotated. The content is thus only interpretable by humans. An interesting observation from the
        analysis is that newspapers produce linked data in the form of metadata, but do not link to already existing
        data, such as persons mentioned in articles. Links could have been made to knowledge bases such as DBpedia or
        Wikidata.
    </p>


    <h3>Why semantically annotating articles is useful</h3>

    <p>
        To make a case for the practice of semantically annotating articles it is necessary to explain why it is useful.
        Multiple use cases can be created for it. An easy one would be the fact that when articles become annotated
        newspapers can become knowledge bases themselves. However, it will then also be possible to time-travel through
        the knowledge base, as content in newspapers is produced constantly. Perhaps this content modifies earlier
        statements about a topic. This means that for a certain topic a timeline can easily be generated based on the
        articles’ publishing data.

    </p>

    <p>
        A second use case would be semantic searching of news. Currently when one is looking for information the
        searching is mainly done on keywords. If however the search is based on semantics, it could be much more
        accurate. A search engine could, for example, already extract statements from an article and immediately display
        them to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another, more specific, use case would be in the reporting of events such as elections. During such events a lot
        of claims are made by people. These claims can either be true or false. If such claims were in articles and
        annotated as a Claim, other applications could index these claims and ask experts to create a ClaimReview. The
        original article could then automatically link to these claim reviews to show readers the overall verdict about
        a claim when they are reading the article. Perhaps when a lot more content and information is available as
        linked data such claims can even be reviewed automatically, however, it should be visible if done automatically
        to let the reader know it might not be a 100% correct.
    </p>

    <h3>Possible approaches</h3>

    <p>The annotating process of articles could be done in multiple ways, each is described shortly.</p>

    <p>Authors annotate their content themselves, this can happen, for example, just before publishing. This does
       however require that all authors know which concepts exist and how they translate to the content.
    </p>


    <p>
        A specialist employee annotates all articles. This means authors can focus on their core job and do not need to
        learn new technology that has no real use to them. This employee has all the knowledge to annotate and can thus
        create good semantic annotations.
    </p>
<br/>
    <p>
        Both of the options above can be made easier and more efficient by introducing a controlled natural language.
        Davis et al. already demonstrated that this is possible, however, their research was in a stricter domain [Davis
        et al. 2009], where newspaper articles are a rather large and unbound domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        A definite requirement is that the annotation process is relatively user friendly. For this a WYSIWYM
        (What-you-see-is-what-you-mean) editor is useful. Khalili & Auer have designed such an editor where it is
        possible to author content and immediately annotate it [Khalili & Auer 2013]. Furthermore, it is possible to
        have a NLP API process the content to annotate parts it understands, this however is not guaranteed to give good
        results.

    </p>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>

    <p>
        Although semantically annotating articles is a good idea and actually provides the world with more structured
        information, it has some issues. Most of these issues are not technical.
    </p>

    <p>
        Semantically annotating articles mainly helps others, it does not necessarily benefit the newspaper. A newspaper
        will have an extra job besides writing the content but they might not actually see, for example, an increase in
        profit. Instead it might be possible that there are less actual readers because much of the information found in
        an article is already shown by a search engine that a reader used to find articles. A newspaper thus has no real
        economical benefit from annotating articles. If a newspaper decides to annotate articles it does so for the
        greater good.
        This issue however, can be countered when the cost becomes low. This could be possible in the future when
        natural language processing becomes advanced enough to be able to interpret and then annotate news articles.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another issue is in the domain of copyright. If articles are publicly accessible it still means that there is a
        copyright on the content of the article, it is not in the public domain. However, indexer are still able to
        index the annotated content and use it to create other applications. There is no easy solution to this. One way
        would be that content creators, newspapers in this case, explicitly notify an indexer of content that can be
        indexed, for example by pushing the URL of an article to an API. This way the newspaper decides whether or not
        the content is indexed. However, this means that all indexers have to follow the same rules.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>This focus paper has made a case for semantically annotating news articles. It is a useful endeavour and can
       enhance the information brought forth by news articles. However, certain issues exist. The most important one
       being that newspapers have no immediate economic benefit from annotating articles. There is no direct solution
       for this, but perhaps economical incentives, e.g. subsidies, can convince newspapers to start.
       The author expects that news articles will be annotated in the future, the only question is when.
