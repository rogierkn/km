<h1>Summaries for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge and Media</h3>

<p class="counter">
Knowledge organisation systems (KOS) are systems that are designed to store and later on present knowledge. An offline example of a KOS is a library, whereas the digital equivalent would be wikipedia. The knowledge stored in a KOS can be represented through multiple types of media, examples of which are natural language texts, diagrams, or sound. Knowledge in a system can be seen as a resource, something that can help achieve a goal. It is important that these resources are stored in an organised matter so that they can be retrieved rather easily. The resources should be stored in a KOS whenever they are created, further modifications should update the resource so that the resource always represents its most up to date state. The organisation of a KOS has to be considered as different groups or people represent knowledge in different ways. This means that if a domain expert add the knowledge, someone else might not be able to correctly interpret the knowledge. The representation of the knowledge, and the medium used, should ultimately depend on the end user so that they can easily interact with the knowledge.

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

Non profit organisations (NPOs) often have a volunteer coordinator managing the volunteers. A great diversity of information needs to be stored and retrievable by these coordinators and other stakeholders. This is often inefficiently achieved by creating ‘homebrew’ databases, applications that are overloaded to accommodate more than what they were designed for [Voida et al. 2011]. More efficient solutions are often not available due to lack of technical expertise of the coordinators as they experts the domain of the NPO. Constantly changing information requirements also make it hard to design proper systems that can generate clear reports. Furthermore, information management does not have a high priority for many coordinators, it is considered overhead. Paper is also still a pervasive information management tool within NPOs as it is often a single source, unlike digital files that are copied regularly. Paper however does not scale with the needs of the NPO [Voida et al. 2011].<br/>
Introducing more human-centered databases, and import  export standards could help making proper solutions more widespread within NPOs as it would reduce the currently experienced overhead and allow for more fluidity in the data used in the NPO.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter">
Traditionally content on the web was not published structurally. Structured content is becoming more prevalent on the web. It allows for more interactive systems. An application that boosted the use of structured data greatly is text search. In 2011, search engines together created Schema.org, a single vocabulary that can be used by websites to present their data in a structured manner. A sample of 10 billion webpages showed that 31.3% have adopted the Schema.org vocabulary to present structured data [Guha et al. 2016]. It should be noted that there are other formats besides Schema.org, but their vocabularies are limited.<br/>
Schema.org was designed to make it easier for websites to present data at the cost that consumers of the data have it slightly harder. Schema.org's adoption can be attributed to this strategy. The vocabulary can also be extended, which is regularly done by communities working together to document new terms. Some of these vocabularies might be integrated into the core vocabulary. With this Schema.org tries to be as open as possible so that many stakeholders can participate in the evolvement of the vocabulary.
