<h1>Summaries for Week 2</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Resource Descriptions</h3>

<p class="counter">
When the need arises to organise resources it becomes required that the resources are describable. It then becomes possible to search for resources, distinguish them and provide access. The describing of resources is done through its properties, e.g. a unique identifier. Properties can either be intrinsic or extrinsic, and dynamic and static. These properties can be used to categorise resources. The process of categorisation is done in a principled way for the best results, however it is nearly always biased and subjective.
Tagging is another way to categorise resources, however it is often not principled and done loosely and often also only describes parts of what the resource is about.
Through categorisation it becomes possible to use resources in computer systems. Logic and ontologies help in making resources interpretable for computers. It becomes possible to introduce relations between resources, and rules, extending the usability of the resources.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Shoham 2015</h3>

<p class="counter">
Currently there is a lot of attention for the machine learning and statistical algorithms parts of artificial intelligence (AI), in the 1990s the focus was more on logic-based AI portrayed as Knowledge Representation (KR). Shoham [Shoham 2015] argues that there is too much focus on the former, which is done through a personal story. The story portrays the issue of time management, an issue that has been prevalent for many years. Shoham theorises and designs an application, that is based on the AGM framework, that helps intelligently plan intentions. Intentions can be everyday things such as events, meetings, plans to exercise etc., they have (temporal) attributes that specify constraints. Intentions are the core of the system, the objects algorithms use to intelligently plan. Shoham states that they are a form of KR in the system. Furthermore, Shoham explains how philosophical literature has helped with certain product design decisions. Finally, it is concluded that KR has played a definite role in reaching the current system. However, it is not impossible to think that without KR the same system would have been created.

<h3>Benson and Karger 2014</h3>

<p class="counter">
Often end-users have a hard time to publish information in the same manner as found on professional websites [Benson and Karger 2014]. Exhibit tries to fill this niche. Exhibit tries to provide easy access but also support power users by using the star model. Analysis is done on the use of Exhibit by interviewing its users and analysing the created Exhibits. Not many of the interviewed had prior experience in data visualisation. Reasons they use Exhibit were: possibility of navigating through data, the ability to publish data without programming, ability to provide understanding of the presented data, and frustrations that came from normal web development. Much of the used data was created in tools such as Excel like tools, even if the data was not in a tabular format. The data was then often copied into existing visualisations. Concluded was that they understand complex data models, but are unable to use proper editors for that, in result they abuse the spreadsheet format for that data. Visualisations are often hard to integrate in the CMSs used. Finally, the star model allows non-trained people to still create data-rich visualisations.

<h3>Haas et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Traditionally search results have consisted of small pieces of text and blue links [Haas et al. 2011]. However, the concept of enhanced search results is researched by Haas et al., and whether enhanced search results are something that is preferred by users. 
In the research, enhanced search results are generated by using and interpreting structured data. An a/b-test evaluation is performed in which the preference of users is analysed by measuring the click-through-rate (CTR). The results show that in the enhanced search results the CTR was on average 15% higher.
It is also noted that even though the availability of structured data is low, most search results can be enhanced by at least one type of enhancement (video, reference, product, etc.). Furthermore, the presence of enhancements helps guide users to relevant results.

<h3>Berners-Lee et al. 2001</h3>

<p class="counter">
The web today consists mostly of content that is only human readable and not easily interpretable for machines [Berners-Lee et al, 2001]. The Semantic Web is supposed to change that. Software agents will be able to read data and add meaning to said data, turning it into usable information. The Semantic Web is extending the current World Wide Web. It is required that agents have structured access to the necessary information, this can be achieved through Knowledge Representation Systems. However, these systems often are centralised, whereas it is necessary for the Semantic Web that information is distributed. XML and RDF are ways to express semantics on the web, and can link to unique objects with Universal Resource Identifiers. Challenges remaining are rules about the interpreting data. Two things might be the same but presented in different formats.
The Semantic Web becomes most useful when software agents will be able to exchange the information and discover each other independently.
Finally, the Semantic Web might enter the physical realm, pointing and interacting with objects in this realm.
